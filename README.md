** Small storyline **

Short and sad, the framework used is a framework I made back in early 2011. The login and registration, are both based upon Ajax (As you can see in the javascript files [Here][1]).

Originally I handcoded everything, and compiled it with a minifier. I knew about JQuery at the time, but I refused to use it due of the huge size (At the time, I was all about optimisation).

As for our current website, I actually think I did a pretty good job. If the .htaccess file that's in the master tree works, the website should work in web browsers without javascript as well, fluently.
